# basecamp-slack-link-unfurler
Basecamp Slack Link Unfurler is an AWS Lambda function written in Ruby that listens for Slack link_shared events that contain Basecamp links and uses the chat.unfurl API to augment the corresponding messages with card previews. This project is also an experiment to see how to build a project from scratch using ChatGPT.
